# Together Forever

This was my honors project for the Programing Paradigms class in 2016. Basically, this is cooperative Brick Breaker. Instructions for the game can be found in game. Run the batch file to play! 

For this project we were individually tasked with creating a 'somewhat' complex multithreaded video game with Java using a MVC architecture. 

**Project Requirements**

 - Pause functionality
 - Save/Load of game state
 - Clear instructions
 - Multiple threads controlling different objects
 - A player controlled object
 - A non-player controlled object

I spent about two weeks on and off creating this game and received an A for the assignment. Woo!

*There is still a known bug for the ball to 'phase' through objects*
